The wav file was converted from mp3 format from the link above, and aac files are generated by **fdkaac 1.0.2 and fdk-aac 2.0.2** (with both 64bit, -O0).

Although the signature at the end of AAC file generated by different binaries (with different compiler optimization options and different binary platforms) is slightly different, the audio data encoded by the same version of the encoder should be the same. Therefore, this test will compare audio coding data in pulse code modulation (PCM file) instead of directly comparing AAC files.

It should be noted that the above test materials are generated by a specific version of the encoder, so they can only be used for comparison with the corresponding version of the encoder; Otherwise, the comparison may produce inconsistent test results due to the change of encoder algorithm (see https://github.com/kekyo/fdk-aac-win32-builder/pull/5 for detailed discussion).
